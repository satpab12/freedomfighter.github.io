Mahatma Gandhi, widely known as Gandhi Ji, was a prominent leader and a symbol
 of nonviolent resistance in India's struggle for independence from British rule. 
Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, Gandhi Ji advocated for the principles
 of truth, nonviolence, and civil disobedience, which he called Satyagraha. He led
 numerous peaceful protests and movements, including the famous Salt March, to challenge 
British colonial rule. Gandhi Ji's philosophy of ahimsa (nonviolence) inspired people around
 the world and became a guiding principle for civil rights and freedom movements globally.
 His relentless pursuit of justice, equality, and communal harmony made him an enduring symbol
 of peace and an icon of the 20th century. Despite facing imprisonment and hardship, Gandhi Ji's
 teachings and legacy continue to inspire generations, reminding us of the power of compassion,
 self-discipline, and unwavering determination in the face of adversity. <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>
